# RUSSELL LOHINAU
This mod is (supposed to be) a Super Monkey Ball
mod for Quake 2, based in Yamagi Quake

# INSTALL/RUN
This was built for, and on Linux Ubuntu so the following guide is catered to that.
Download this as a ZIP and then extraxt it all into a seperate, new folder in your
Quake 2 directory. Take "run_mod.sh" and modify the path to fit your specific
install directory and then run "run_mod.sh" and, voila~!
